# 3D Programming
NPL/ParaEngine provides rich set of graphical API and libraries to create sophisticated interactive 3D application.
ParaEngine used to be a full-featured computer game engine, it is now built-in with NPLRuntime.
ParaEngine implementation is C/C++ based. All of its API can be accessed via NPL scripts. 

## Example 3D Projects
- [Paracraft](http://www.paracraft.cn): is a 3D animation software written completely in NPL with over half million lines of NPL code. 
- [Haqi](http://haqi.61.com): is a 3D MMORPG written completely in NPL with over 1 million lines of NPL code.
